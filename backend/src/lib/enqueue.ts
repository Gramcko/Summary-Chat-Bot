/**
 * Backend queue producer for `generate-summary` jobs (architecture
 * A5.2/A6, docs/decisions/0003-queue-strategy.md).
 *
 * Job-id mechanism (verified against the installed bullmq 6.5.2
 * sources — `scripts/addStandardJob-9.lua` and `scripts/removeJob-2.lua`):
 *
 * - `jobId = summaryRunId`. BullMQ's add script treats a duplicate id
 *   as a hard dedupe: when the job key EXISTS the new job is silently
 *   dropped (`handleDuplicatedJob` emits a `duplicated` event and
 *   returns the existing id). That gives "at most ONE live job per
 *   run" for free — concurrent double-enqueues collapse into one job.
 * - The same mechanism is also a trap: a FINISHED job is retained in
 *   Redis for a while (`removeOnComplete`/`removeOnFail` keep the last
 *   {@link SUMMARY_FINISHED_JOBS_KEPT} per state), and its job key
 *   still EXISTS — so a plain re-add after completion would be
 *   silently dropped and the re-enqueue would be lost.
 * - Therefore every enqueue goes through {@link enqueueSummaryRun}:
 *   a live job (waiting/active/delayed/prioritized/waiting-children)
 *   is left alone (dedupe), while a DEAD job (completed/failed) is
 *   removed first and then re-added. Removal is safe by construction:
 *   BullMQ's remove script refuses LOCKED (active) jobs — it returns
 *   code 0 and removes nothing — so an active job can never be yanked
 *   mid-processing even if its state changed between our check and the
 *   remove. Code 0 (or a job that became live again) means "leave it";
 *   we then skip the add and keep exactly one live job per run.
 *
 * Enqueue failures propagate to the caller: routes leave the run
 * `pending` and log a safe operational error (architecture A6 — the
 * durable run is created BEFORE the enqueue attempt, so a failed
 * enqueue is always recoverable by the reconciliation pass).
